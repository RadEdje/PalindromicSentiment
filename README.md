# PalindromicSentiment
Can AI interpret backwards

I saw this poem today on May 23, 2018.
It's not mine but it sparked an idea or rather a problem in my head.
An AI/ML problem or challenge so to speak.
We've all heard about sentiment analysis but can AI interpret backwards and forwards the way we can?
I'm leaving a copy of the poem for anywone to work on or see here.
I'll come back to it soon since I'm still figuring out computer vision AI algorithms but this poem just suddenly made me want to get into sentiment analysis.
