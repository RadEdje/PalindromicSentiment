# PalindromicSentiment
Can AI interpret backwards

I saw this poem today on May 23, 2018.
It's not mine but it sparked an idea or rather a problem in my head.
An AI/ML problem or challenge so to speak.
We've all heard about sentiment analysis but can AI interpret backwards and forwards the way we can?
I'm leaving a copy of the poem for anywone to work on or see here.
I'll come back to it soon since I'm still figuring out computer vision AI algorithms but this poem just suddenly made me want to get into sentiment analysis.


PRETTY UGLY
by Abdullah Shoaib

I am very ugly
so don’t try to convince me that
I’m a very beautiful person
because at the end of the day
I hate myself in every single way
And I’m not going to lie to myself by saying
There’s Beauty inside of me that matters
So rest assured I will always remind myself
That I am a worthless, terrible person
And nothing you say will make me believe
I still deserve love
Because no matter what
I am not good enough to be loved
And I am in no position to believe that
Beauty does exist within Me
Because whenever I look in the mirror I always think
Am I as ugly as people say?

(Now, read from the bottom to the top!!)
